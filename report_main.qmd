# Introduction

With advancements in global medicine, public health, and living standards, life expectancy has continued to reach new heights. It is often regarded as a key indicator of peopleâ€™s well-being. However, the relationship between life expectancy and life satisfaction may vary across countries and regions, influenced by differences in cultural values, economic development, and societal expectations.This report explores the question: Do Europe and Asia experience similar trends in life expectancy and life satisfaction? To address this question, we analyze publicly available data from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/life-satisfaction-vs-life-expectancy), which includes standardized country-level measures of life expectancy and self-reported life satisfaction. Our analysis focuses on Europe and Asia. By cleaning and analyzing data, we discuss the visualization results and key findings.
