## Problem introduction

With advancements in global medicine, public health, and living standards, life expectancy has continued to reach new heights. It is often regarded as a key indicator of people’s well-being. However, the relationship between life expectancy and life satisfaction may vary across countries and regions, influenced by differences in cultural values, economic development, and societal expectations.

-   Research question: Do Europe and Asia experience similar trends in life expectancy and life satisfaction?

-   Data Source: [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/life-satisfaction-vs-life-expectancy)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Dataset description 

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| message: false
#| warning: false
raw_data <- read_csv("life-satisfaction-vs-life-expectancy.csv")

region_map <- raw_data %>%
  filter(!is.na(`World regions according to OWID`)) %>%
  distinct(Entity, `World regions according to OWID`) %>%
  deframe() 

filled_region <- raw_data %>%
  mutate(`World regions according to OWID` =
           coalesce(`World regions according to OWID`,
                    region_map[Entity]))


cleaned <- filled_region %>%
  mutate(`Life expectancy (years)` = `Life expectancy - Sex: all - Age: 0 - Variant: estimates`) %>%
  select(-`Life expectancy - Sex: all - Age: 0 - Variant: estimates`) %>%
  filter(!is.na(`Life expectancy (years)`), !is.na(`Cantril ladder score`))

cleaned %>%
  filter(`World regions according to OWID` %in% c("Europe", "Asia")) %>%
  write_csv("europe_asia.csv")

europe_asia <- read_csv("europe_asia.csv")
```

```{r}
#| label: fig-table-asia-europe
#| fig-cap: "Europe and Asia filtered dataset"
head(europe_asia[, c("Entity", "Code", "Year", "Cantril ladder score", "Life expectancy (years)")])
```

<div style="font-size:0.80em">

- Our dataset was cleaned to ensure all observations included the 'World regions according to OWID' variable, which was initially onle recorded once.

- Our dataset was then filtered to contain only observations with values for both key metrics, ensuring that missing values did not undermine the analysis.

## Methods

```{r}

long_data <- europe_asia %>%
  filter(Year == 2023) %>%
  select(`World regions according to OWID`, 
         `Life expectancy (years)`, 
         `Cantril ladder score`) %>%
pivot_longer(
  cols = c(`Life expectancy (years)`, `Cantril ladder score`),
  names_to = "Variable",
  values_to = "Value")
  
ggplot(long_data, aes(x = Value, fill = `World regions according to OWID`)) +

## Results

```{r}

# Load filtered dataset that includes only Europe and Asia
europe_asia <- read_csv("europe_asia.csv")

# Compute population-weighted yearly averages for each region
region_avg <- europe_asia %>%
  
  # Remove any missing values in key variables
  filter( 
    !is.na(`Life expectancy (years)`),
    !is.na(`Cantril ladder score`),
    !is.na(`Population (historical)`),
    !is.na(Year)
  ) %>%
  group_by(`World regions according to OWID`, Year) %>%
  summarise( 
    
    # Weighted mean life expectancy using historical population
    `Life expectancy (years)` = weighted.mean(
      `Life expectancy (years)`, `Population (historical)`, na.rm = TRUE),
    
    # Weighted mean life satisfaction using same population weights

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Conclusion

-   Overall quality of life has improved in both Europe and Asia.

-   Europe shows steady progress in health and well-being, with more uniform development.

-   Asia has wider variation, including extreme cases.

-   Differences in medical systems, economies, and social support impact well-being.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Conclusion

- **World Happiness Report 2020**  
  Europe’s welfare systems support stable improvement in well-being  
  Asia’s rapid growth with social pressure leads to more volatility  

- **COVID-19 pandemic (CDC, 2021)**  
  Decline in both regions linked to the pandemic’s severe impact  
  Affected both life expectancy and subjective well-being  

- Europe’s high-welfare models ensure stable outcomes, while Asia still shows clear room for improvement.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Recommendations

-   Asian governments could consider using happiness indices in policy decisions.

-   Strive to balance longevity with subjective well-being.

-   Future research could expand to include other global regions and investigate potential causal relationships.

-   Consider including variables such as occupational inequality, income inequality and educational attainment.
