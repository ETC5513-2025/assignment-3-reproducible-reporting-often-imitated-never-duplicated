## Executive Summary

-   Analyzed trends in life expectancy and life satisfaction from 2011 to 2023.
-   Europe performed consistently well in both indicators.
-   Asia showed greater variation, some countries lag behind in the two indicators.
-   Balanced improvement in Life Expectancy and life satisfaction is essential

## Introduction

With advancements in global medicine, public health, and living standards, life expectancy has continued to reach new heights. It is often regarded as a key indicator of people’s well-being. However, the relationship between life expectancy and life satisfaction may vary across countries and regions, influenced by differences in cultural values, economic development, and societal expectations.

-   Research question: Do Europe and Asia experience similar trends in life expectancy and life satisfaction?

## Methodology

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| message: false
#| warning: false
raw_data <- read_csv("life-satisfaction-vs-life-expectancy.csv")

region_map <- raw_data %>%
  filter(!is.na(`World regions according to OWID`)) %>%
  distinct(Entity, `World regions according to OWID`) %>%
  deframe() 

filled_region <- raw_data %>%
  mutate(`World regions according to OWID` =
           coalesce(`World regions according to OWID`,
                    region_map[Entity]))


cleaned <- filled_region %>%
  mutate(`Life expectancy (years)` = `Life expectancy - Sex: all - Age: 0 - Variant: estimates`) %>%
  select(-`Life expectancy - Sex: all - Age: 0 - Variant: estimates`) %>%
  filter(!is.na(`Life expectancy (years)`), !is.na(`Cantril ladder score`))

cleaned %>%
  filter(`World regions according to OWID` %in% c("Europe", "Asia")) %>%
  write_csv("europe_asia.csv")

europe_asia <- read_csv("europe_asia.csv")
```

```{r}
#| label: fig-table-asia-europe
#| fig-cap: "Europe and Asia filtered dataset"
head(europe_asia[, c("Entity", "Code", "Year", "Cantril ladder score", "Life expectancy (years)")])
```
Our dataset was cleaned to ensure all observations included the 'World regions according to OWID' variable, which was initially onle recorded once. 

Our dataset was then filtered to contain only observations with values for both key metrics, ensuring that missing values did not undermine the analysis.

## Discussion & Conclusion

- Overall quality of life has improved in both Europe and Asia.

- Europe shows steady progress in health and well-being, with more uniform development.

- Asia has wider variation, including extreme cases.

- Differences in medical systems, economies, and social support impact well-being.

- Europe’s high-welfare models ensure stable outcomes, while Asia still shows clear room for improvement.

---

## Recommendations

-   Asian governments could consider using happiness indices in policy decisions.

-   Strive to balance longevity with subjective well-being.

-   Future research could expand to include other global regions and investigate potential causal relationships.

-   Consider including variables such as occupational inequality, income inequality and educational attainment.
